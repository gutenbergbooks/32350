Nicaragua occupies a strategic position in Central America with respect
to mammalian distributional patterns, but relatively little has been
published concerning the fauna of the country and its zoogeographic
relationships. The present paper records information on distribution,
variation, and natural history of 40 species of bats from Nicaragua, 14
of which are here recorded for the first time from the country.
Appended is a checklist of the chiropteran fauna of Nicaragua in which
only primary literature with actual reference to specimens from the
republic is cited.
</p>

<p>
The specimens upon which this report is based are, with few exceptions,
in the collections of the Museum of Natural History of The University
of Kansas. Some of our material was obtained in 1956 by J. R. and A. A.
Alcorn, field representatives of the Museum and sponsored by the Kansas
University Endowment Association; most of the specimens, however, were
obtained by field parties of which we were members that worked in
Nicaragua in 1964, 1966, 1967, and 1968 under the aegis of a contract
(DA-49-193-MD-2215) between the U.S. Army Medical Research and
Development Command and The University of Kansas. Place-names
associated with localities mentioned in the text from which specimens
at Kansas were collected are plotted on Fig. 1.

north to south; elevations are given in meters or feet, depending on
which was used on specimen labels. All specimens are in the Museum of
Natural History of The University of Kansas unless noted otherwise. We
are indebted to Drs. Charles O. Handley, Jr., and Ronald Pine of the
U.S. National Museum (USNM) for lending us certain critical specimens.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Saccopteryx leptura</b> (Schreber, 1774)
</p>

<p>
Two specimens from El Para&#237;so, 1 km N Cosig&#252;ina, 20 m, Chinandega, on
the Cosig&#252;ina Peninsula, provide the fourth locality of record for this
white-lined bat in Nicaragua. Jones (1964a:506) and Davis <i>et al.</i>
(1964:375) earlier reported a total of eight specimens from the
departments of Managua and Zelaya. The species is known as far north in
Middle America as Chiapas (Carter <i>et al.</i>, 1966:489).
</p>

<p>
Our two bats, both females, were shot on the evening of 1 March 1968 as
they foraged around a yard light. One carried an embryo that measured 8
mm (crown-rump), whereas the other was reproductively inactive.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Peropteryx macrotis macrotis</b> (Wagner, 1843)
</p>

<p>
Four females (one young and three adult) captured 5 km N and 9 km E
Condega, 800 m, in Madriz, on 23 June 1964, provide the first record of
this small sac-winged species from Nicaragua. The bats were shot from
daytime roosts in small, well-lighted, cave-like spaces formed among
immense blocks of granite in a small patch of tropical deciduous forest
surrounded by extensive pine-oak woodland. None of the adult females
was reproductively active. <i>Glossophaga soricina</i>, <i>Diphylla
ecaudata</i>, and a large nursery colony of <i>Desmodus rotundus</i>
were found in association with the <i>Peropteryx</i>. Measurements of
our specimens agree closely with those reported for material from El
Salvador (Felten, 1955:284) and Costa Rica (Starrett and Casebeer,
1968:3-4).
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Noctilio labialis labialis</b> (Kerr, 1792)
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Boaco</i>: 4 km W Teustepe, 140 m, 9.
<i>Chontales</i>: Hato Grande, 13 km S, 8 km W Juigalpa, 60 m, 49.
<i>Rivas</i>: 4 km S, 1.5 km E Alta Gracia, 40 m, Isla de Ometepe, 1;
Finca Amayo, 13 km S, 14 km E Rivas, 40 m, 4. <i>Zelaya</i>: S side
R&#237;o Mico, El Recreo, 25 m, 1; Cara de Mono, 50 m, 2.
</p></div>

<p>
This species has been reported previously from Nicaragua by several
authors. All our specimens were netted over small streams or shot as
they foraged; parts of scarabids and lepidopterans were found in the
mouths of several individuals shot at Finca Amayo. Twenty-six of 31
autopsied females taken in April were pregnant, each containing a
single embryo&#8212;average crown-rump length 16.7 (5-26) mm. Testes of 15
males collected in April had an average length of 4.6 (2-7) mm, those
of four taken in June, 5.2 (4-6) mm.
</p>

<p>
We follow Cabrera (1958:55), Husson (1962:63), and Handley (1966b:758)
in use of the subspecific name <i>labialis,</i> the type locality of
which is the "Mosquito shore" of Nicaragua, rather than Per&#250; as
suggested by Hershkovitz (1949:433-434).
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Noctilio leporinus mexicanus</b> Goldman, 1915
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Chinandega</i>: Potos&#237;, 5 m, 2.
<i>Chontales</i>: Hato Grande, 13 km S, 8 km W Juigalpa, 60 m, 4.
<i>Rivas</i>: 4 km S, 1.5 km E Alta Gracia, 40 m, Isla de Ometepe, 4;
M&#233;rida, 40 m, Isla de Ometepe, 2; Finca Amayo, 13 km S, 14 km E
Rivas, 40 m, 1.
</p></div>

<p>
This fish-eating species, first reported from Nicaragua by Davis <i>et
al.</i> (1964:376), apparently occurs throughout Middle America,
although known from the region by comparatively few records. We have 13
additional Nicaraguan specimens as listed above.
</p>

<p>
The two individuals (both females, one pregnant with an embryo that
measured 20 mm) from Potos&#237; were caught on 6 March in a mist net set
over a large pool in a shallow estuarine stream; the mouth of the
stream opened into the Gulf of Fonseca approximately 200 yards below
our netting site. Other individuals of this species were observed as
they foraged over large pools formed at high tide near the mouth of the
stream. Our other specimens were caught in mist nets set over fresh
water streams near Lake Nicaragua or along the shores of the lake. A
female from near Alta Gracia, caught on 27 March, carried a single
embryo that measured 41 mm, whereas one from Finca Amayo was lactating
on 25 June. Four males taken on Isla de Ometepe in late March and early
April had a mean testicular length of 9.5 (8-10) mm.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Pteronotus davyi fulvus</b> (Thomas, 1892)
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Chontales</i>: Cuapa, 4. <i>Matagalpa</i>: 3
mi E San Ram&#243;n, 126.
</p></div>

<p>
This small naked-backed bat has not been reported previously from
Nicaragua. Autopsy of seven females collected on 9 May near San Ram&#243;n
revealed that four were pregnant, each with a single embryo&#8212;average
crown-rump length 25.0 (21-29) mm.
</p>

<p>
The distribution of <i>P. davyi</i> is poorly known in much of Central
America. The species was reported only recently from Costa Rica
(Starrett and Casebeer, 1968:8) and is unknown from Panam&#225;. We assign
our specimens tentatively to the subspecies <i>fulvus</i> on geographic
grounds.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Pteronotus parnellii fuscus</b> (J. A. Allen, 1911)
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Boaco</i>: Santa Rosa, 17 km N, 15 km E
Boaco, 300 m, 1; Los Cocos, 14 km S Boaco, 220 m, 1. <i>Chinandega</i>:
6.5 km N, 1 km E Cosig&#252;ina, 10 m, 1. <i>Zelaya</i>: Bonanza, 850
ft, 1; 2 mi SW Bonanza, 600 ft, 1; S side R&#237;o Mico, El Recreo, 25
m, 1; Cara de Mono, 50 m, 4.
</p></div>

<p>
Although this species is widespread in Middle America, it has been
known previously from Nicaragua only by a specimen from "Chontales"
(Miller, 1902:402). All of our specimens were captured in mist nets.
Two adult females (one taken on 28 February and the other on 8 March)
each carried a single embryo (13 and 18 mm in crown-rump length,
respectively); a female taken in April was lactating and had a flaccid
uterus suggesting relatively recent parturition. Adult females captured
in the months of June, July, and August evidenced no sign of
reproductive activity. Two of these were in dark, fresh pelage, but one
captured on 24 June and another on 28 July were molting. In both
individuals, active molt evidently had slowed or subsided and remnants
of the old pelage (rich ochraceous orange) were confined to a narrow
strip at the lateral edges of the body.
</p>

<p>
We tentatively apply the subspecies name <i>fuscus</i> to our
Nicaraguan bats on geographic grounds; one of us (Smith) currently is
investigating geographic variation in the genus <i>Pteronotus</i>.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Pteronotus suapurensis</b> (J. A. Allen, 1904)
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Chontales</i>: Cuapa, 1. <i>Matagalpa</i>: 3
mi E San Ram&#243;n, 24. <i>Zelaya</i>: Cara de Mono, 25 m, 4.
</p></div>

<p>
This relatively poorly known monotypic species occurs from southern
Veracruz to the Amazon Basin. It has been reported from several
localities in Central America including one in Nicaragua (Goodwin,
1942a:88). Three pregnant females from near San Ram&#243;n (9 May) carried
embryos that had crown-rump lengths of 27, 27, and 28 mm, and two
netted on 24 April at Cara de Mono each had an embryo that measured 22
mm. All of our specimens are in bright pelage that is fulvous red in
color.
</p>


<p class="subhead">
<b>Micronycteris megalotis mexicana</b> Miller, 1898
</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
<i>Specimens.</i>&#8212;<i>Carazo</i>: 3 km N, 4 km W Diriamba, 600 m,

</p></div>

<p>
The individuals from Isla de Ma&#237;z Grande were shot on 30 June as they
flew from small caves and crevices in rocky outcrops on the south end
of the island. Of the three adult females obtained at that time, two
were lactating; each was accompanied by a young, the forearms of which
measured 19.7 (male) and 21.3 mm (female). Two adult males from Isla
del Ma&#237;z Grande had testes 2 mm in length.

<p>
Four of the five specimens taken northwest of Diriamba were shot from a
daytime retreat in a culvert; the fifth was caught by hand as it
attempted to fly out of a hollow, fallen tree. Two adult females
captured on 31 March were pregnant, each carrying a single embryo (13
and 14 mm in crown-rump length), whereas two obtained on 14 August
showed no sign of reproductive activity. An adult male, also taken on
14 August, had testes 2 mm in length. Of three additional adult
females, one captured on 3 June was pregnant (embryo 21 mm in
crown-rump length), whereas two obtained on 14 April evinced no gross
reproductive activity.
</p>

<p>
The subspecies <i>mexicana</i> has not been reported previously from
Nicaragua, although Gardner <i>et al.</i> (1970:715) recently extended
its known distribution southward from Honduras (Goodwin, 1942c:124) and
El Salvador (Felten, 1956:180) to west-central Costa Rica. In
Nicaragua, as apparently in Costa Rica, <i>mexicana</i> occupies the
Pacific versant, the Caribbean lowlands being inhabited by the smaller
race, <i>Micronycteris megalotis microtis</i> Miller, 1898 (type
locality, Greytown, Nicaragua&#8212;reported also from "R&#237;o Coco,"
Nicaragua, by J. A. Allen, 1910:110). Nicaraguan examples of <i>M. m.
mexicana</i> are, on the average, considerably larger in cranial
dimensions and length of forearm than are specimens of <i>M. m.
microtis</i> (see Table 1). The series of <i>microtis</i> from "R&#237;o
Coco," probably from the headwaters of that stream in the vicinity of
San Juan de R&#237;o Coco and thus near the divide between Caribbean and
Pacific drainages, is intermediate in size between the two subspecies
and suggests intergradation between them. As noted also by Gardner
<i>et al.</i> (1970:715), we find no differences in length of ear
between <i>microtis</i> and <i>mexicana</i> (contrary to Miller's
claim, in the original description, that <i>microtis</i> had noticeably
smaller ears), nor do we note any consistent differences in color
between the two races on the basis of the specimens at hand.
</p>

<p>
Our specimens from Isla del Ma&#237;z Grande inexplicably agree rather
closely in size (average but slightly smaller) with specimens of <i>M.
m. mexicana</i> from western Nicaragua and elsewhere within the range
of the subspecies, and are tentatively, therefore, referred to
<i>mexicana</i>. Four specimens earlier reported (G. M. Allen,
1929:130) from the same island also are relatively large (forearm 35
mm). Further commentary on this insular population must await a time
when additional material is available from Central America.

Only four specimens of this seemingly rare species have been recorded
previously from Nicaragua&#8212;one (the holotype) from Kanawa Creek, near
Cukra, north of Bluefields, 100 ft, Zelaya (Goodwin, 1942b:205),
another from 12.5 mi. S and 13 mi. E Rivas, 125 ft, Rivas (Davis and
Carter, 1962:67-68), and two from 6 km N Tuma, 500 m, Matagalpa (Valdez
and LaVal, 1971:248). Our specimens were caught in mist nets placed
over small, quiet streams that were fringed with tall, gallery forest.
The surrounding areas were savanna-like with small stands of secondary
forest. An adult male taken on 21 April had testes that measured 5 mm
in length, whereas those of another (9 August) were 3 mm.
</p>

<p>
Handley (1966b:761) synonymized <i>T. nicaraguae</i> with <i>Tonatia
minuta</i> Goodwin, 1942, a conclusion with which we agree. However,
the name <i>nicaraguae</i> (Goodwin, 1942b:205) has page priority over
<i>minuta</i> Goodwin (op. cit.:206) and is the valid name for the
species rather than <i>minuta</i> as used by Handley (see also LaVal,
1969:820; Gardner <i>et al.</i>, 1970:716; Valdez and LaVal, 1971:248).
</p>

<p>
Measurements of the two males (that from Hato Grande listed first) are
as follows: total length, 63, 60 mm; length of tail, 5, 6 mm; length of
hind foot, 10, 9 mm; length of ear, 23, 23 mm; length of forearm, 34.5,

7.1 mm; breadth across upper molars, 6.3, 6.5 mm. We have not compared
our specimens directly with others from Middle America. On the basis of
available measurements, they resemble material reported from Honduras
(LaVal, 1969:820), averaging larger than other specimens for which
measurements have been published (see especially Goodwin, 1942b:206;

<p>
A male fringe-lipped bat netted over a small stream at Cara de Mono, 50

the second known occurrence of this species in Nicaragua. Carter <i>et

An adult male captured in a mist net set in a forest clearing at Santa

bat from Nicaragua. The testes of our individual, taken on 1 July 1966,
were 6 mm in length. Externally and cranially our Nicaraguan example
closely resembles specimens of <i>C. auritus</i> from Veracruz and the
Yucat&#225;n Peninsula. Handley (1966b:762) and Starrett and Casebeer
(1968:12) expressed doubt as to the validity of the currently used

measurements of the material at hand with those given in various
published accounts&#8212;Burt and Stirton (1961), Starrett and Casebeer
(1968), and Thomas (1905), for example&#8212;reveal little variation. Until
additional information is available (especially as concerns the South

the first record of this glossophagine from Nicaragua. Two males each
had testes 6 mm in length; one female evidenced no reproduction
activity, whereas another carried an embryo 4 mm in crown-rump length.
In addition to our material, there is a specimen in the British Museum
(BM 8.6.22.4) from Cafetal "Concordia," 4000 ft, Jinotega.
</p>

<p>
It may be noteworthy that the two localities at which this bat is known

follows: Santa Rosa, 17 km N and 15 km E Boaco, 300 m, Boaco (an adult

<p>
Bats of this species apparently are common in the Caribbean lowlands of
Nicaragua; the highest altitude at which we have taken specimens is 660
meters. The only previous report of <i>C. castanea</i> from Nicaragua
evidently is that of Davis <i>et al.</i> (1964:379), who mentioned it
in passing (from Cacao, Zelaya) in an account of <i>Macrophyllum
macrophyllum</i>. Two adult females each carried an embryo having
crown-rump lengths of 20 (21 March) and 10 mm (27 July). Adult females
evincing no gross reproductive activity were taken in February (one),
March (one), April (four), June (three), July (two), and August (two).
Four adult males netted on 24 April had testes with an average length
of 7.0 (5-9) mm, whereas those of four other adult males taken in late
June had an average of 4.0 (2-6) mm.
</p>

<p>
In our collections from Nicaragua, we find at least three kinds of
<i>Carollia</i> and we follow Handley (1966b:764-765) in tentatively
assigning these to <i>C. castanea</i>, <i>C. subrufa</i>, and <i>C.
perspicillata</i>. The systematics of this genus is currently under
study by Ronald H. Pine. In Nicaragua, <i>castanea</i> differs from
<i>subrufa</i> (with which it has been confused in the past) in being
smaller, both externally and cranially, and much darker in color as
well as in the additional characters mentioned by Handley (<i>loc.

both from the relatively dry northwestern Departamento de Chinandega.
On 8 July 1966, a male (testes 2 mm) was netted under trees along a

Chontales (Davis <i>et al.</i>, 1964:383), and the other from 3 mi NNW
Diriamba, Carazo (Jones, 1964a:507). This bat was relatively rare in
collections until the last decade or so. Handley (1966b:766) reported
<i>V. helleri</i> as abundant in the lowland areas of Panam&#225;, and we
found the same to be true in Nicaragua. We suspect that future
investigations in Middle America will reveal this species to be a
common member of lowland tropical communities. It is known as far north
as southern Veracruz (Carter <i>et al.</i>, 1966:494).
</p>

<p>
Most of our specimens were captured in mist nets set over small streams
bordered by gallery forest, or in banana groves. The range of
ecological conditions in which this species was taken is represented by
the semiarid environment of the Cosig&#252;ina Peninsula in northwestern
Nicaragua and the humid tropical forest (secondary growth) in the
vicinity of El Recreo in the Caribbean lowlands. Pregnant females were
captured in March, April, June, July, and August, indicating that this
species probably breeds throughout much of the year.

adult males captured in March and April had an average length of 4.4
(3-7) mm, whereas those of two taken in July were 3 mm in length.

<b>Artibeus toltecus hesperus</b> Davis, 1969
</p>

<p>
When Davis (1969) named <i>A. t. hesperus</i>, he assigned specimens
only from as far south as El Salvador to the new subspecies, referring
the three Nicaraguan examples of the species at his disposal to the
nominal race. On the night of 6-7 April 1968, one of us (Smith) netted
bats on the south part of Isla de Ometepe at a place 2 km N and 3 km E
M&#233;rida, 200 meters in elevation. One net was set across, and another
parallel to, a small, boulder-strewn stream; the surrounding area was
planted to coffee and had a good canopy of tall deciduous trees. Among
the bats captured at this location were 10 <i>A. toltecus</i> that are
referable to the subspecies <i>hesperus</i>, judging by their small
size (Table 2).
</p>

<p>
Six of our specimens are females and each carried an embryo (range in
crown-rump length 20-28 mm). Three adult males had testes 5, 6, and 7
mm in length. External measurements (extremes in parentheses) of our
series are: total length, 55.9 (51-60) mm; length of hind foot, 10.7
(10-12) mm; length of ear, 14.8 (14-16) mm; weight of four males, 9.9
(8.8-11.5) gms; weight of six pregnant females, 14.9 (12.7-16.9) gms.

This bat has been reported from Nicaragua previously by Andersen
(1908:300) and Davis (1969:28), based on a total of four specimens. We
netted this species at Santa Mar&#237;a de Ostuma in patches of cloud forest
at a cafetal. The specimen from near Esquipulas was taken in a net
placed across a trail in second growth forest. Two females collected on
11 April and one taken on 30 June were pregnant (embryos 21, 26, and 12
mm, respectively, in crown-rump length). Testes of a male netted on 14
March were 7 mm in length, whereas those of two obtained on 11 April
measured 4 and 7 mm. Selected measurements of our six specimens are

<p>
Davis (1970a:393-394) recently reviewed the systematic status of this
small fruit-eating bat and recorded specimens from southeastern
Nicaragua; the species was first reported from the country by Andersen
(1908:290), based on a specimen from the Escondido River. Our
additional material reveals that <i>A. watsoni</i> occurs throughout
eastern Nicaragua, the specimen from Nueva Segovia extending the known
range as mapped by Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
</p>

<p>
A female from Bonanza (23 February) carried an embryo 14 mm in
crown-rump length, whereas one from El Recreo (26 February) was not
reproductively active; one of two females netted near Villa Somoza in
early August was pregnant (embryo 21 mm in crown-rump length). Seven
adult males collected in late February and early March had an average
testicular length of 5.9 (5-7) mm; testes of two adults taken in late
June and one captured in early August all measured 5 mm. The testes of
young males (grayish pelage, partially unfused phalangeal epiphyses)
were 2 or 3 mm in length.

<p>
Paradiso (1967) reviewed geographic variation in this unique bat, the
type locality of which was restricted to Realejo, Chinandega,
Nicaragua, by Goodwin (1946:327). Because additional material had not
been reported from Nicaragua, Paradiso (<i>op. cit.</i>:598) felt it
was "premature to restrict the type locality to a specific area in that
country" (the holotype was obtained on the voyage of the H.M.S.
Sulphur, which called at Realejo), and preferred the more general
designation "west coast of Mexico or Central America." In view of the
fact that we now have specimens from but a few miles distant from
Realejo (at San Antonio), we see no reason to contest Goodwin's
restriction of the type locality to that place.
</p>

<p>
Specimens from San Antonio were collected along a small stream,
bordered by a bilevel gallery forest, in an area otherwise planted
mostly to cane. Many trees of the lower level were covered by an
extremely thick network of vines, which were interwoven with branches
and supported fallen leaves and debris from the upper level. This
situation led to formation of small "rooms" or "cubicles" under some
shorter trees; the bats were shot as they hung from small branches
under one such tree, which was in fruit. All of our other specimens
were captured in mist nets.
</p>

<p>
Pregnant females were taken on the following dates (crown-rump length
of embryo in parentheses): 25 February (12 mm), 2 March (17 mm), 15
March (14 mm); a nonpregnant female also was taken on 15 March. Five
males captured at San Antonio on 9 and 10 March had an average
testicular length of 5.6 (5-6) mm. A male taken in July had testes 4 mm
in length, whereas those of one obtained on 14 March were 5 mm long.
</p>

<p>
Selected measurements (average, with extremes in parentheses) of 11
adults (seven males and four females) are as follows: length of
forearm, 42.5 (41.5-43.7) mm; condylobasal length (10 specimens only),
14.8 (14.5-15.0) mm; zygomatic breadth, 14.8 (14.4-15.1) mm;
interorbital breadth, 5.0 (4.7-5.2) mm; breadth across upper molars,
10.6 (10.5-11.0) mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 5.0 (4.8-5.3) mm.
These measurements generally agree with those given by Paradiso
(1967:600) for 20 individuals from Panam&#225;. Females in our series
average slightly larger than do males in external and cranial
measurements. Six males weighed an average of 22.9 (20.7-25.1) gms; one
nonpregnant female weighed 17.1 gms.

Our specimens constitute the first report of this species from

</p>

<p>
Specimens from Los Cocos (three males and two females) were captured in
a mist net stretched across a large, quiet pool in a small stream. The
banks supported well-developed gallery forest, the understory of which
had been cleared for human habitation; grassland (grazed) and small
stands of secondary forest obtained beyond the riparian habitat.
Domestic ducks, a possible source of food, were observed sleeping along
the bank of this stream and on top of large boulders situated in the
stream. Males from this locality taken on 20 February, 4 April, and 18
July had testicular lengths of 5, 6, and 6.5 mm, respectively. Two
adult females collected there on 4 April were reproductively inactive.
An adult male (testes 6 mm) from near Condega was captured on 23 June
in a daytime roost in a small, cave-like crevice (see account of
<i>Peropteryx marcotis</i>), and one from northeast of Esquipulas
(testes 5 mm) was netted on 14 March along a forest trail (see account
of <i>Vampyressa pusilla</i>).

<p>
This funnel-eared species occupies an extensive geographic range
(northern M&#233;xico to Brazil) but appears to be relatively rare in Middle
America to the south of Guatemala. Our specimens represent the first of
this species to be reported from Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
Both specimens from El Recreo, adult males, were caught by hand at
night after they flew through an open door into a small room, possibly
seeking insects that were swarming around a light bulb. Those from near
Nandaime (three males, two females) were caught in a mist net set over
the mouth of a well in which they were roosting; the well was
approximately 2 m in diameter, and the water level was about 5 m below
the rim. The females were not reproductively active (6 August).
</p>

<p>
We have compared our Nicaraguan material with a number of Mexican
specimens, including the holotype of <i>N. s. saturatus</i> and
topotypes of <i>N. s. mexicanus</i>. We concur with Goodwin (1959) that
in M&#233;xico there are two rather distinct subspecies, between which a
broad zone of intergradation obtains. Our Nicaraguan specimens agree
most closely with <i>N. s. saturatus</i>, and, until additional
comparative material is available from Middle America, we tentatively
refer them to that race. Handley (1966b:770) and Starrett and Casebeer
(1968:15), however, regarded <i>mexicanus</i> as the appropriate name
for specimens from Panam&#225; and Costa Rica.

This handsome <i>Myotis</i> has been reported previously from Nicaragua
only from the Caribbean lowlands&#8212;from the Escondido and Prinzapolka
rivers (Miller and Allen, 1928:203). We netted two specimens, both
males, at Santa Rosa, 17 km N and 15 km E Boaco, 300 m, Boaco, in
central Nicaragua on 13 July and 9 August 1967, under the same
conditions described in the account of <i>Myotis elegans</i>. Testes of
our specimens were 7 and 6 mm, respectively, in length. External and
cranial measurements are as follows: total length, 84, 83 mm; length of
tail, 31, 33 mm; length of hind foot, 9, 9 mm; length of ear, 15, 15

17 km N and 15 km E Boaco, 300 m, Boaco. It was captured in a mist net
as it foraged over a small stream that supported relatively
well-developed gallery forest along the bank. The surrounding area was
grassland (grazed), with small patches of tropical forest located on
the sides of hills. Twenty other species of bats were taken at this
same locality including <i>Myotis argentatus</i> and <i>Myotis

This small Neotropical <i>Myotis</i> has been reported from Nicaragua
only from the Caribbean lowlands of Zelaya (Davis <i>et al.</i>,
1964:379). Our records indicate that it is widely distributed in the
republic but evidently nowhere common. Females taken on 5 March and 6
August each carried a single embryo (7 and 13 mm in crown-rump length,
respectively), whereas one obtained on 21 July evidenced no
reproductive activity. Richard K. LaVal currently is studying the

<b>Myotis simus riparius</b> Handley, 1960
</p>

<p>
A male (USNM 52800) from the Escondido River above Bluefields,
originally reported by Miller and Allen (1928:203) as one of two <i>M.
albescens</i> from that locality, provides the first record of the
species from Nicaragua and the northernmost from Middle America. The
cranial dimensions of this specimen, which compare well with those
listed by Handley (1960:467) for the Panamanian holotype and paratype,
are: greatest length of skull, 13.8 mm; zygomatic breadth, 8.9 mm;
postorbital constriction, 3.5 mm; breadth of braincase, 6.7 mm; mastoid
breadth, 7.4 mm; breadth across upper molars, 5.5 mm; length of
maxillary toothrow, 5.2 mm.
</p>

<p>
From Nicaraguan specimens of <i>albescens</i>, the skull of the
specimen of <i>simus</i> examined (skin not seen) differs most
conspicuously in having a less inflated braincase, narrower postorbital
region, and a distinct sagittal crest.

from Greytown (Miller, 1897:100). Except for two individuals that were
shot as they foraged in early evening, our specimens were captured in
mist nets stretched over water or as described below.
</p>

<p>
Some of the bats captured northwest of Diriamba were taken in a net
placed across the center of a water-filled, concrete cistern that was
located in a large, open space used for drying coffee beans. Open at
the top, the cistern was approximately 12 m in diameter, and the water
level was approximately 3 m below the rim. Several <i>Artibeus
jamaicensis</i>, <i>A. lituratus</i>, and <i>Molossus pretiosus</i>
were caught in the same net. Aside from bats removed from the net, a
few <i>Eptesicus</i> and <i>Molossus</i> were retrieved from the water
where they fell, apparently stunned, after colliding with the wall of
the cistern. The fact that a number of decomposed bats of these two
species were observed floating in the water indicated that such
entrapment was not caused by the placement of our net.

A female pregnant with two embryos (crown-rump length 15 mm) was

This small vespertilionid occurs throughout much of Central America,
but the available material still is insufficient to permit an accurate
assessment of geographic variation in that region. All but one of our
specimens were trapped in mist nets. Those captured near Diriamba were
taken in a net stretched across a trail bordered by high cut-banks,
whereas those from other localities were netted over small streams. The
one bat from Bellavista was shot as it foraged in the evening along
trees bordering the hacienda yard.
</p>

<p>
Two females taken on 5 March each had swollen uteri and may have been
in an early stage of pregnancy. Others taken on 13 July, 9 August, and
15 August were reproductively inactive. Males had testes that measured
2.5 (March), 3 (July), and 2 (August) mm.

<p>
We have compared our material with representative specimens from M&#233;xico
of <i>R. parvula</i> and <i>R. tumida</i>, as defined by Goodwin
(1958); we are not wholly convinced that these are valid species
(rather than variable geographic races of the same species). Certainly
there is need for additional investigation of the problem. Our
Nicaraguan specimens most closely resemble <i>R. t. tumida</i> (see
Goodwin, <i>op. cit.</i>:3), to which they are tentatively referred.

A broken skull (USNM 339917) of a female of this species from Hda.
Mecatepe [2 km N, 11.5 km E Nandaime, <i>ca.</i> 40 m], Granada,
represents the only known specimen of the genus <i>Eumops</i> from
Nicaragua. This bat was obtained by M. K. Clark on 25 August 1964, but
the conditions under which it was captured are not known. Available
cranial measurements are: zygomatic breadth, 12.6 mm; breadth of
braincase, 10.7 mm; postorbital breadth, 4.3 mm; rostral breadth, 7.4
mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 9.1 mm; length of mandibular c-m3,
10.0 mm.

Only one specimen of this large molossid (from Volc&#225;n de Chinandega&#8212;J.
A. Allen, 1908:670) has been reported from Nicaragua. All of our
specimens are from the northern or northwestern part of the country.
Many were shot in early evening as they followed a straight, direct
flight pattern (presumably from day-roosts toward foraging or watering
areas); the series from Potos&#237; was netted over a small stream as
described in the account of <i>Noctilio leporinus</i>. We confidently
refer our material to the species currently known as <i>ater</i>,
although assignment to the subspecies nigricans is tentative.
</p>

<p>
Of 21 females autopsied in the first week of March on the Cosig&#252;ina
Peninsula, seven were pregnant, each with a single embryo (7-22 mm in
crown-rump length, average 16.7). Ten males taken at the same time had
an average testicular length of 5.7 (2-7) mm, whereas the testes of a
male obtained on 9 March at San Antonio measured 8 mm. None of five
females obtained in late July in Nueva Segovia evidenced reproductive
activity, nor did two of three females taken in July and one taken in
August from Chinandega; the fourth Chinandegan female, taken on 17
July, carried an embryo that was 36 mm in length. Two males from
southern Chinandega (mid-July) had testes 7 and 4 mm long.

Representative measurements of 10 specimens of each sex from Nicaragua
are given in Table 4.

This small free-tailed species has been reported from Nicaragua by
Felten (1957:14), who listed two females from Corinto. Our records
indicate that it is widely distributed, but of localized occurrence.
Specimens from Potos&#237; and Santa Rosa were captured in mist nets over
streams (as described in the accounts of <i>Noctilio leporinus</i> and
<i>Myotis elegans</i>, respectively). The specimen from Hda. San Isidro
was shot in flight, whereas those from Rivas were captured in a daytime
retreat in a deep crevice in a concrete school building. We have no
precise knowledge of the conditions under which bats from 3 mi SW
Managua were obtained but suspect they were taken from a building.
</p>

<p>
Females in our series were reproductively active at all times for which
we have information&#8212;early March through mid-July&#8212;as follows: a female
from Potos&#237; (6 March) carried an embryo that measured 5 mm (crown-rump
length) as did one from Santa Rosa (21 March, 17 mm in length); two of
three females taken 3 mi SW Managua on 28 March were pregnant (embryos
13 and 15 mm), whereas each of two collected there on 3 May were gravid
(embryos 27 and 30 mm); one female from Rivas (25 June) carried an
embryo (30 mm) and another was lactating and accompanied by a small
(forearm, 19.7 mm) hairless juvenile; and, finally, one of six females
netted at Santa Rosa on 13 July was pregnant (embryo 23 mm), but the
others evinced no reproductive activity. An adult male, taken at Rivas
with the females mentioned above, had testes that were 6 mm in length.
</p>

<p>
Bats of the genus <i>Molossus</i> are in need of thorough systematic
study. We think most, if not all, mainland populations of small
<i>Molossus</i> with pale-based hairs pertain to the species
<i>Molossus molossus</i>, originally described from the Lesser
Antilles. Although there is some variation in size and overall color
among our Nicaraguan samples, all seem to represent that species.
Because specimens from Nicaragua closely resemble examples of <i>M. m.
aztecus</i> from Jalisco, M&#233;xico (Table 3), in external and cranial
proportions, we tentatively refer them to <i>aztecus</i>.
</p>

<p>
In our field experience in both Middle and South America, colonies of
<i>M. molossus</i> tend to be extremely localized, with individual
populations or demes frequently separated by many miles of territory in
which the species seemingly does not regularly occur.

<p>
The localized and presumably highly inbred populations may have
diverged morphologically, in some cases at least, to a degree that
mensural differences can be demonstrated even between samples from the
same general geographic area. Localized variation and relatively marked
secondary sexual variation (unrecognized by some earlier workers),
superimposed on geographic variation, have resulted in application of a
relatively large number of names to these small <i>Molossus</i>. Felten
(1957:13-14), for example, apparently used different specific names for
males and females from El Salvador, and Gardner (1966) employed three
different specific names for North American specimens. Only when
material is available for a detailed study of variation throughout the
Neotropics can the perplexing mosaic of characters in these small
<i>Molossus</i> be assessed adequately.
</p>

<p>
We have seen no specimens from Nicaragua that are identifiable as
<i>Molossus bondae</i>, another relatively small species that has been
reported from Greytown (Miller, 1913a:89) and from elsewhere in Central
America by other authors (Goodwin, 1942c:145; Handley, 1966b:772;
Gardner <i>et al.</i>, 1970:727). Our examination of the female
holotype of <i>M. bondae</i> reveals that it is larger than <i>M.
molossus</i>, corresponding in size to females recently reported from
Costa Rica by Gardner <i>et al.</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), and that
<i>bondae</i> has dark-based hairs. The two males reported by Goodwin
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) from Honduras as <i>bondae</i>, would seem to be too
small for that species, based on the measurements listed; also, these
specimens allegedly have white-based hairs and probably represent <i>M.
molossus</i> as here defined.
</p>

This relatively large mastiff bat has not been reported previously from
Nicaragua. Specimens from several localities in Boaco were captured in
mist nets over streams; most of those from northwest of Diriamba were
shot in the early evening as they foraged high around large trees in a
coffee finca, but several were netted over a water-filled concrete tank
or found in the water in the tank as detailed in the account of
<i>Eptesicus furinalis</i>. At Los Cocos, bats that we netted seemed to
be emerging from a hollow located high in a tree over the stream.
</p>

<p>
Selected measurements of <i>M. p. pretiosus</i> from Nicaragua, which
compare favorably with those of topotypes from Venezuela, are listed in
Table 4 along with measurements of <i>M. ater</i> and <i>M.
sinaloae</i>. The taxonomic relationships of <i>M. pretiosus</i> and
<i>M. ater</i> are less than clear, and some authors (Handley,
1966b:773, for instance) have suggested that the two may be
conspecific. Whatever their ultimate relationships may prove to be, two
distinctive taxa seem to be present in Nicaragua; the larger is
assignable to <i>ater</i> and the smaller to <i>pretiosus</i>, as
currently understood. Furthermore, the presumed presence of two large
<i>Molossus</i> with dark-based hairs elsewhere in Central America
(Dilford C. Carter, personal communication) and in southeastern M&#233;xico
(Goodwin, 1956:4; Goodwin and Greenhall, 1964:20) argues for specific
recognition of <i>pretiosus</i>.
</p>

<p>
The species <i>ater</i> and <i>pretiosus</i> differ mainly in size
(Table 4), some measurements clearly separating the two when sexual
dimorphism is considered. Also, the average weights of 18 nonpregnant
females and four males of <i>pretiosus</i> (all adults) collected on 20
February 1968 at Los Cocos, were 20.9 (14.6-23.8) and 27.0 (24.6-31.7)
gms, respectively, significantly smaller than corresponding figures for
11 nonpregnant females and nine males of <i>M. a. nigricans</i> taken
two weeks later on the Cosig&#252;ina Peninsula&#8212;29.1 (26.1-33.0) and 32.9
(29.3-35.1) gms. It is of note that we have not collected these two
large species at the same localities in Nicaragua, and it is possible
that one competitively excludes the other in local situations.

Among females from Departamento de Boaco, none of 18 collected on 20
February was pregnant, whereas three of four obtained on 4 April were
gravid (embryos 13, 15, and 17 mm in crown-rump length) as was one
(embryo 21 mm) taken on 18 July. Among those from northwest of
Diriamba, two of three were pregnant on 30-31 March (embryos 7 and 13
mm in length), whereas only three of eight carried embryos (29, 31, and
34 mm) in mid-August at a time when flying young also were collected.
Additionally, a female captured 6 mi WSW Managua on 27 March had an
embryo that measured 11 mm. </p>

<p> Four adult males collected on 20 February had an average testicular
length of 5.7 (4-7) mm, whereas those of seven obtained in late March
averaged 5.0 (4-6) mm; testes of two adults taken on 18 July were 6 and
6.5 mm, and those of three taken in the period 12-15 August were 5 mm
in length.

This mastiff bat can be distinguished easily from the other two large
species of <i>Molossus</i> in Nicaragua in that the hairs of the dorsum
are relatively long and are pale, frequently white, basally. The
species has been reported twice previously from Nicaragua&#8212;from
Greytown by Miller (1913a:89) and by Goodwin and Greenhall (1964:13),
who listed four individuals from R&#237;o Grande.
</p>

<p>
Most of our specimens were taken from buildings. A large series
obtained in a house at El Recreo in late June 1966 consisted only of
females and young, many of which were nearly full grown; some females
still were lactating and at least two were pregnant (on 23
June&#8212;crown-rump length of embryos 12 and 14 mm). A group taken
from another house at El Recreo (from cracks in the stone wall and from
between rafters and the corrugated metal roof) in late July 1966
consisted of adult males, lactating females, and young. Similarly, an
adult male, a pregnant female (embryo 14 mm in crown-rump length), and
a hairless juvenile were shot, on 16 February 1964, from a small colony
in an attic of a large house southwest of Managua; <i>Glossophaga
soricina</i> also was taken in this attic. The testes of an adult male
captured in June were 6 mm in length; those of four taken in July were
5, 5, 6, and 7 mm, and one obtained in August had testes that measured
3 mm.

Selected measurements of <i>M. s. sinaloae</i> from El Recreo are given

<p>
Following is a checklist of the 68 species of bats thus far reported
from Nicaragua. Citations are given only to publications that are
primary sources of information on Nicaraguan specimens. In some
instances, specimens were reported in the literature under a name
different than the one here employed; we have mentioned earlier-used
names where it seemed appropriate to do so. Taxa preceded by an
asterisk are included in the present paper.
